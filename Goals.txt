THE PROBLEM:
	Moving and facing a inherently tied problems, such that moving is handle in respect to the direction of current facing.
	Ideally, moving and facing should be independant process when handled by EEG.


INTERMEDIATE GOALS:
	Familiarize group with use of openViBE software and Emotiv EPOC.

	Design and implement simple classifiers to solve the problem in the single dimension input scenario.
		Classifier should be able to quntize brainwaves into simple input (i.e. left, right, up, down, etc.)
		Classifier should also handle this in a learning process (i.e. analyze patterns of brainwaves and extrapolate accordingly).

        Refine classifier and possibly signal processing for two-dimensional system (move and look independantly on 2D plane).
		Signal processor should be able to break a complex waveform into simpler ones (possibly in various spaces) to
			allow easier pattern recognition in the classifier

		Classifier should be able to handle (possibly multiple) waveforms and translate into a combination of
			 commands (i.e. left + up, left + down, etc.).


END GOAL:
	Measure EEG signals and use the groups written classifiers to allow three-dimensional movement 		
	independent of the direction the subject is facing.
