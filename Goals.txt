THE PROBLEM:


INTERMEDIATE GOALS:
	Familiarize group with use of openViBE software and Emotiv Epoc

	Design and implement simple classifiers to solve the problem in the single dimension input 		
	scenario.


END GOAL:
	Measure EEG signals and use the groups written classifiers to allow three-dimensional movement 		
	independent of the direction the subject is facing.
