Project

Machine Learning on Brainwaves

Description
-----------------------------------------
This project aims to read in brainwaves with an Arduino microcontroller. 
These brainwaves will then be processed by a machine learning algorithm to extract patterns within the brainwaves.
Given a certain pattern, the program should then output some sort of keyboard command to a separate program,
which, in turn, will be used to control a simple game (Pac-Man, etc.). Additionally, the program should be able
to create a new learned set off of a minimal amount of repetitions of a pattern (i.e. it should be able to be used
by a new user with minimal time learning the patterns).
