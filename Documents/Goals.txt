**END GOAL**:
	Use EEG signals to interface with a computer by emulating keyboard and mouse signals. These inputs will
	be fed into some sort of emulated or direct computer game and be used to control the game.


**INTERMEDIATE GOALS**:
	Familiarize group with use of openViBE software and Emotiv EPOC.

	Create an algorithm which will detect brain wave patterns from the EPOC through the drivers provided by openViBE.
		This algroithm will be used to create a classifier which will codify brain waves into certain sets,
		which, in turn, will eventually be transformed into the keyboard or mouse commands.

		Classifier should be able to handle (possibly multiple) waveforms and translate into a combination of
			 commands (i.e. left + up, left + down, etc.).

	(Side note: Possible expansion by adding more keys or key combinations to a list of possible commands. Perhaps
		    start with fewer total keys that have patterns associated with a key press.)

	Create a program which will create a basis set for the pattern matching algorithm. This program should prompt the user
		to make some action repeatedly for each key to create a set of patterns for each command. Ideally, these patterns should
		be consistent enough to extrapolate to future actions that are passed to the pattern matching algorithm. 	

	(Side note: Possible expansion by creating a signal processor which will boost the signal of the patterns received to
		    recognise thoughts of actions rather than directly acting.)


**TESTING GOALS**:
	In order to test the functionallity of both the pattern matching algorithm and the basis set creator, we will test both
		in conjunction with openViBE and the EPOC on a small game program (emulated or otherwise). A user should be able
		to run the program, create a basis set by being prompted, and then play the game using the gestures they specified
		in the basis set creation.

	Other tests may be added later to show complete or extended functionality of the program.
